# Machine Learning Projects Repository 🚀

Welcome to the repository containing all of my **Machine Learning projects**! This repo showcases various ML models and techniques, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation for each project.

## Repository Overview 📂

This repository includes **18 Machine Learning projects** where each project focuses on different types of models and problems such as prediction, classification, regression, and recommendation systems. Each project folder contains:

- **Dataset** 📊: Relevant datasets for the project, often in `.csv` format.
- **Python Script** 🐍: The implementation of the model in Python, using libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.
